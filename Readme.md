#jsQwerty

A reusable virtual keyboard plugin in JavaScript. Simple to use and can be added to any number of input fields on a page. Pops into view as soon as the user focuses on a text box on the page.

To use it on your page include the script and stylesheet, and then pass an array of your input elements to the `attachKeyboard` function. Example:

`attachKeyboard( [ document.getElementById('txt1'), document.getElementById('txt2') ] );`
